  ## Syntax
  # f = <../findr.m *findr*> (r) 

  ## Description
  # Subfunction to find specific growth rate
  #
  # Input:
  #
  # * r: scalar with guess for specific growth rate
  #
  # Output:
  #
  # * f: scalar that has value 0 if r is the correct specific growth rate
  
  ## Remarks:
  # Routine called from 'flux' for 'plant' to obtain specific growth rates.
  # Requires:
  #  par1 = [y_CH_E?_NO, y_V?_E?, y_EN?_E?, kap_S?, k_E?, k_EC?, k_EN?, j_E?_M?];
  #  par2 = [A_?, m_EC?, m_EN?, m_E?]; ? can be S or R, for shoot or root
  
  #global par1 par2;
  
  a = par2[2]*(par2[1]*par1[6] - r)/par1[1];
  # spec mobilisation from reserve EC in terms of E
  b = par2[3]*(par2[1]*par1[7] - r)/par1[3];
  # spec mobilisation from reserve EN in terms of E
  d = 1/(1/a + 1/b - 1/(a + b));
  # stoichiometrically merged spec flux from reserves EC and EN in terms of E
  c =         par2[4]*(par2[1]*par1[5] - r); # spec flux from reserve E

  f = par1[2]*(par1[4]*(c + d) - par1[8]) - r;
  # par1(4)*(c+d) is spec E-flux allocated to growth + som maint
